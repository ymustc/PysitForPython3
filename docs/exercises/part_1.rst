Part 1: The Foward Problem
**************************

In this exercise, you will implement a solver for the 1D scalar acoustic wave
equation with absorbing boundary conditions,

.. math::

   (\frac{1}{c(x)^2}\partial_{tt}-\partial_{xx})u(x,t) & = f(x,t),  \\
   (\frac{1}{c(0)}\partial_t-\partial_x)u(0,t) & = 0, \\
   (\frac{1}{c(1)}\partial_t+\partial_x)u(1,t) & = 0, \\
   u(x,t) & = 0 \quad\text{for}\quad t \le 0,

where the middle two equations are the absorbing boundary conditions, the last
equation gives initial conditions, :math:`x \in [0,1]`, and :math:`t \in
[0,T]`. The model velocity is given by the function :math:`c(x)`.

In our notation, we write that solving this PDE is equivalent to applying a
nonlinear operator :math:`\mathcal{F}` to a model parameter :math:`m`, where
:math:`m(x) = \frac{1}{c(x)^2}` for the scalar acoustics problem.

We then write that :math:`\mathcal{F}[m] = u`.

Seismic Sources
===============

Before we can solve the equation, we need to define our source function.

We define our source functions as :math:`f(x,t) = w(t)\delta(x-x_s)`, where
:math:`\ w` is the time profile, :math:`\delta` indicates that we will use
point sources, and the source location is :math:`x_0`. In real world
applications, the time profile is not known and is estimated as part of the
inverse problem. However, it is common to model source signals with the
negative second derivative of a Gaussian, also known as the Ricker Wavelet,

.. math::

   w(t) = (1-2\pi^2\nu_0^2t^2)e^{-\pi^2\nu_0^2t^2},

where :math:`\nu_0` is known as the characteristic or peak frequency (in Hz),
because the magitude of :math:`w`'s Fourier transform :math:`|\hat w|` attains
its maximum at that frequency. It is also important that this function is
causal (:math:`w(t) = 0` for :math:`t\le 0`), so we introduce a time shift
:math:`t_0`,

.. math::

   w(t) = (1-2\pi^2\nu_0^2(t-t_0)^2)e^{-\pi^2\nu_0^2(t-t_0)^2}.


.. topic:: Problem 1.1

    Write a Python function ``ricker(t, config)`` which implements the Ricker
    Wavelet, taking a time ``t`` in seconds and your configuration dictionary.
    This function should assume that your configuration dictionary has a key
    ``nu0`` representing the peak frequency, in Hz.  Your function should
    returns the value of the wavelet at time ``t``.

    You can guarantee causality by setting :math:`t_0= 6\sigma` for
    :math:`\sigma = \tfrac{1}{\pi\nu_0\sqrt{2}}`, the standard deviation of
    the underlying Gaussian. You may also want to implement an optional
    threshold to prevent excessively small numbers.

    Plot your function for :math:`t = 0, \dots, T=0.5` at :math:`\nu_0 =
    10\textrm{Hz}` and label the plot.


    .. code:: python

        # In fwi.py

        def ricker(t, config):

            nu0 = config['nu0']

            # implementation goes here

            return w

        # Configure source wavelet
        config['nu0'] = 10 #Hz

        # Evaluate wavelet and plot it
        ts = np.linspace(0, 0.5, 1000)
        ws = ricker(ts, config)

        plt.figure()
        plt.plot(ts, ws,
                 color='green',
                 label=r'$\nu_0 =\,{0}$Hz'.format(config['nu0']),
                 linewidth=2)
        plt.xlabel(r'$t$', fontsize=18)
        plt.ylabel(r'$w(t)$', fontsize=18)
        plt.title('Ricker Wavelet', fontsize=22)
        plt.legend();

.. topic:: Problem 1.2

    Write a Python function ``point_source(value, position, config)`` which
    takes a value ``value``, a source location ``position``, and uses the
    range of the spatial domain ``config['x_limits']``, and the number of
    points ``config['nx']`` from the configuration to implement a numerical
    approximation to the :math:`\delta`. This function should return a numpy
    array with ``value`` at the correct index, correctly evaluating
    :math:`w(t)\delta(x-x_s)` for ``value = ricker(t)``. Be careful with your
    implementation of the numerical delta, as :math:`\int
    \delta(x-x_s)\textrm{d}x = 1`.

    To implement ``point_source``, we need to discretize the problem domain.  This is stored in the configuration as follows::

        # Domain parameters
        config['x_limits'] = [0.0, 1.0]
        config['nx'] = 201
        config['dx'] = (config['x_limits'][1] - config['x_limits'][0]) / (config['nx']-1)

    For later, we also specify the location of the source::

        # Source parameter
        config['x_s'] = 0.1

    .. note::

        Your function should take a ``position`` as a separate parameter and
        not automatically extract the source location from ``config`` because
        we will re-use this function later.


Wave Solver
===========

The scalar acoustic wave equation can be written as

.. math::

   (M\partial_{tt} + A\partial_t + K)u(x,t) = f(x,t),


where :math:`K = K_x + K_{xx}` is called the stiffness matrix and contains the
spatial derivatives, :math:`A` is the attenuation matrix and relates to the
first time derivatives in the boundary conditions, and :math:`M` is the mass
matrix and relates to the second time derivatives in the bulk.


.. topic:: Problem 1.3

    Write a Python function which ``construct_matrices(C, config)`` which
    constructs the matrices :math:`M`, :math:`A`, :math:`K` for a given model
    velocity ``C``. Use a second order accurate finite difference for the
    second spatial derivative and and use an 'upwinded' forward or backward
    first order difference scheme for the first spatial derivatives.

    .. admonition:: Hint

        It may be helpful to write down precisely what the differential
        equation looks like at the each interesting point (the two boundaries
        and some point in the middle of the domain) for your discretized
        wavefield :math:`u(j\Delta x, n \Delta t)`.

    .. admonition:: Hint

        The matrices are not time dependent, so :math:`n` is fixed. Which
        :math:`j` are relevant at each of the spatial points?

    .. code:: python

        # Load the model
        C, C0 = basic_model(config)

        # Build an example set of matrices
        M, A, K = construct_matrices(C, config)

We can discretize the time derivatives using the usual second-order accurate
finite difference approximation,

.. math::

   \partial_{tt}u(x,t) \approx \frac{u(x,t-\Delta t) - 2u(x,t) + u(x,t+\Delta
   t)}{\Delta t^2},

which will result in the explicit 'leap-frog' scheme for computing
:math:`u(x,t+\Delta t)`. For explicit methods, the stability of the scheme is
restricted by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition,

.. math::

   \Delta t \le \alpha\frac{\Delta x}{c_\text{max}}.

.. topic:: Problem 1.4

    Write a Python function ``leap_frog(C, sources, config)`` which takes a
    velocity ``C``, a list of source wavefields ``sources`` (one element for
    each time step), and through the ``config``, takes a time step ``dt``, and
    a number of time steps ``nt`` and returns the time series of wavefields
    :math:`u`. Use :math:`\alpha = \dfrac{1}{6}` and :math:`x_s = 0.1`.

    .. admonition:: Hint

        Your ``leap_frog`` function should use your ``construct_matrices``
        function.


    .. code:: python

        # Set CFL safety constant
        config['alpha'] = 1.0/6.0

        # Define time step parameters
        config['T'] = 3  # seconds
        config['dt'] = config['alpha'] * config['dx'] / C.max()
        config['nt'] = int(config['T']/config['dt'])

        # Generate the sources
        sources = list()
        for i in xrange(config['nt']):
            t = i*config['dt']
            f = point_source(ricker(t, config), config['x_s'], config)
            sources.append(f)

        # Generate wavefields
        us = leap_frog(C, sources, config)

At this point, it is important to visualize the wavefield (and the medium the
waves are propagating in).  One way to look at the wavefield of a 1D problem
is to consider a plot of its space-time diagram.

.. topic:: Problem 1.5

    Write a Python function ``plot_space_time(us, config)``, using the
    matplotlib command ``imshow``, to plot and label the space-time diagram
    for a wavefield :math:`u(x,t)`.

    .. admonition:: Hint

        The matplotlib ``xticks`` and ``yticks`` functions will be useful. Try
        to use  a gray-scale color map and consider an optional argument to
        set the title.


    .. code:: python

        plot_space_time(us, config, title=r'u(x,t)')


    .. image:: ../_static/exercises/p1_5.png

Data and Sampling
=================

A *receiver* (a seismometer, hydrophone, or geophone) at spatial position
:math:`x_r` records the value of the true wavefield (or a function of it) at a
point, and is written mathematically as

.. math::

   d_r(t) = d(x_r,t) = \int_\Omega u(x,t) \delta(x - x_r)\textrm{d}x.

For 2D and 3D seismic imaging problems there are multiple receivers at
different spatial positions recording data for a single 'shot' (instance of a
source). This 'sampling' can be denoted with the operator :math:`\mathbf{S}`
and is written as

.. math::


   \mathbf{d}(t) =
       \left[
           \begin{array}{c}
                d_{r_1}(t) \\
                d_{r_2}(t) \\
                \vdots \\
                d_{r_n}(t)
            \end{array}
        \right] =
        \left[
            \begin{array}{c}
                \int_\Omega u(x,t) \delta(x - x_{r_1})\textrm{d}x \\
                \int_\Omega u(x,t) \delta(x - x_{r_2})\textrm{d}x \\
                \vdots \\
                \int_\Omega u(x,t) \delta(x - x_{r_n})\textrm{d}x
            \end{array}
        \right] =
        \mathbf{S}u(x,t).


Your ``point_source`` function implements the adjoint operation of sampling,
:math:`\mathbf{S^*}`.

.. topic:: Problem 1.6

    Write a function ``record_data(u, config)``, which takes a single
    wavefield ``u`` and, as part of the configuration, a receiver position in
    ``config['x_r']`` and returns the measured data.  When combined, data from
    all time steps form a *trace*.

    Use :math:`x_r = 0.15`.


    .. code:: python

        # Receiver position
        config['x_r'] = 0.15


Forward Operator
================

At this point, you have all of the routines necessary to solve the forward problem,

.. math::

   \mathcal{F}\left[ m \right] = u.

It will be useful to put the necessary steps into a function, as we will want
to solve this problem many times, perhaps on different problems. Additionally,
we will frequently want to solve the sampled forward problem,

.. math::

   \mathbf{S}\mathcal{F}\left[ m \right] = d.

.. topic:: Problem 1.7

    Write a Python function ``forward_operator(C, config)`` which returns a
    tuple containing the wavefields and the sampled data. This function should
    utilize the functions you have written in the previous exercises.

    Plot and label the trace. Use :math:`x_r = 0.15`.

Bonus Problems
==============

**Bonus Problem 1.8:** Derive how you might use your ``leap_frog`` function and
periodic boundary conditions to design a 4th order accurate, in both space
and time, scheme for solving the wave equation.


**Bonus Problem 1.9:** The implementation of time stepping used in this exercise
is not the most efficient approach for implementing time stepping,
particularly in higher dimensions. Why? What might be a faster way to
implement the time stepping?


**Bonus Problem 1.10:** The wave equation can be solved using an ODE integrator.
Change the formulation of the wave equation so that this is possible. Write a
function that uses the `built-in SciPy ODE integrator
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html#scipy.integrate.odeint>`__
to do your time stepping.
