Introduction to Full Waveform Inversion
***************************************

These exercises develop a time-domain adjoint-state based 1D seismic inversion
code, from the wave solver through the optimization routine.  They
simultaneously serve as an introduction to full waveform inversion, numerical
Python, and PySIT.

While they do not use PySIT directly, the development over the course of the
problems produces a code that has a similar structure as PySIT. As such, they
serve as a great introduction to the design and organization of PySIT.

Laurent Demanet's `notes on Waves and Imaging
<http://math.mit.edu/icg/resources/notes325.pdf>`_ are frequently referenced.

These problems were developed as part of the computational section of the 2013
MSRI Summer School on the Introduction to the Mathematics of Seismic Imaging.
