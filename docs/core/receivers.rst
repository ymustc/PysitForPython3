Introduction
============

A  PySIT Receiver object specifies the modeling of seismic receivers.


Getting Started
===============

* Importing a receiver
* Constructing a receiver from a mesh and its coordinates


Using `receivers`
=================

.. THIS SECTION SHOULD BE EITHER

More details

Point Receivers
---------------

* Sampling operators
* Sampling data from a wavefield

Delta Approximations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Numerical delta
* Gaussian delta

Sparse or Dense?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Use sparse, in general

Data Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Time domain data
* Frequency domain data

Receiver Sets
-------------

* Collections of receivers
* Behaves the same as a `~pysit.core.receivers.PointReceiver`

Extending `receivers`
=====================

Define the required interfaces for receivers objects
