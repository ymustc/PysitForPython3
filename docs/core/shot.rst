Introduction
============

A  PySIT Shot object specifies the modeling of seismic shot.


Getting Started
===============

* Importing Shot
* Constructing a shot from a source and a receiver


Using `shot`
============

.. THIS SECTION SHOULD BE EITHER

More details

* Accessing sources (note, even single sources are referred to in the plural)
* Accessing receivers

Shots as `list` Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* PySIT variables `shots` (plural) assume more than one shot in an iterable container
* PySIT variables `shot` (singular) assume a single instance of a `~pysit.core.shot.Shot` object
* Plural is used for mathematical operations on multiple shots, singular is for things that deal with a single shot
