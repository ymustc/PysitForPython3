Introduction
============

A  PySIT Source object specifies the modeling of seismic sources.


Getting Started
===============

* Importing a source
* Constructing a source from a mesh and its coordinates
* Selecting a profile function


Using `sources`
===============

.. THIS SECTION SHOULD BE EITHER

More details

Point Sources
---------------

* Adjoint of sampling operators
* Extending sources to wavefields

Delta Approximations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Numerical delta
* Gaussian delta

Sparse or Dense?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Use sparse, in general

Evaluation of a Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Time domain
* Frequency domain

Source Sets
-----------

* Collections of sources
* Behaves the same as a `~pysit.core.sources.PointSource`, but for multiple simultaneous sources

Extending `sources`
=====================

Define the required interfaces for sources objects
