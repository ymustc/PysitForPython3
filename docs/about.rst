About

The Python Seismic Imaging Toolbox (PySIT) is research-scale platform for
developing and prototyping numerical methods and algorithms for seismic
imaging and full waveform inversion (FWI), in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions.  PySIT
is designed to be a common platform which implements the standard seismic
imaging methods from the literature and from which the Imaging and Computing
Group at MIT, and outside research groups, can quickly develop and prototype
new methods, and reproducibly compare or benchmark those new methods against
the state of the art in the field.

PySIT is designed to accelerate the development of seismic imaging algorithms
by providing an interface that is consistent with, and in fact reads like,
`our derivation of the mathematics of seismic imaging
<http://math.mit.edu/icg/resources/>`_.  By combining this with the
accessibility of the Python programming language (from both the programming
and monetary cost perspectives), PySIT provides an efficient environment for
incorporating new research, and training new researchers, on short time
scales.

With PySIT, we aim to cleanly and efficiently provide an open platform for
future development of seismic imaging methods, both at MIT and elsewhere. 
Moreover, by embracing an open development model, we aim to encourage
cooperation within the research community and to facilitate reproducible
research.
